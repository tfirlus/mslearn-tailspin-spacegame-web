# Under the steps section, you see the build tasks that maps to each of the script commands that we identified earlier.
#
# Azure Pipelines provides built-in build tasks that map to many common build activities.
# For example, the DotNetCoreCLI@2 task maps to the dotnet command-line utility.
# The pipeline uses DotNetCoreCLI@2 two times: one time to restore, or install, the project's dependencies, and one time to build the project.
#
# Remember that not all build activities map to a built-in task.
# For example, there's no built-in task that runs the node-Sass utility, or writes build info to a text file.
# To run general system commands, you use the CmdLine@2 or script task.
# The pipeline uses the script task because it's a common shortcut for CmdLine@2.

# $(Build.DefinitionName) specifies the name of the build pipeline. For example, "SpaceGame-Web-CI."
# $(Build.BuildId) is a numeric identifier for the completed build, like 115.
# $(Build.BuildNumber) is name of the completed build. You can configure the format,
#    but by default the build number includes the current date followed by the build number for that day.
#    An example build number is "20190329.1."
